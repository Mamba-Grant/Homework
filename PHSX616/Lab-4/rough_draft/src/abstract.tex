    The band structure is a fundamental concept in the field of condensed matter physics, and is an essential consideration in the engineering of materials in all modern electronics. Despite this, it remains very hard to develop a strong, experimental intuition for the concept without extremely expensive pump-probe microscopy such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. For this reason we propose an acoustic analogue, requiring only basic experimental equipment to model a 1-D lattice and the band structure. 
    %Furthermore we demonstrate the effects of broken symmetry in this chain to elucidate on the importance of doping for device design.
