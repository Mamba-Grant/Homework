In this paper, we demonstrate an analogous acoustic experiment for the tight binding model by exploring the theoretical background to express eigenmodes of the system, relating this to the eigenmodes in the acoustic equivalent and to the $k$-vectors. This allows us to plot a full and reduced zone scheme of our band structure.

Our key limitations in this experiment are equipment quality. Use of digital equipment and a computer driven control ought to allow students to accurately observe higher order states and construct a larger band structure.
