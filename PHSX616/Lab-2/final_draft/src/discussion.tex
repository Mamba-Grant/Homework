\section{\label{sec:level1}DISCUSSION}\label{sec:discussion}

In this paper, we demonstrate the linear correlation in frequency and resistance for Johnson noise, and in doing so we fit a value for Boltzmann's constant, $k_B=1.33\times10^{-23} \pm 1.30\times10^{-24}$. The associated z-score of this is $-0.376$, suggesting my data models the now accepted value for Boltzmann's constant well. The exceptionally low chi-square value 
suggests that this could be improved further with more data, to observe the spread of data more completely.
