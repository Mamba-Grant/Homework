    It had been known in Johnson's time that the characteristic noise of linear electronics, attributed to statistical mechanical effects, was a function of bandwidth and resistance, and was white in nature. We attempt to replicate Johnson's original work using an array of modern amplifiers and band pass filters to assess the resistance and frequency correlation in this noise, which has come to be known as Johnson noise. We conclude with high certainty that resistance and bandwidth dependences are linearly correlated, and use these results to provide a strong estimate of Boltzmann's constant.
