    %\textit{The abstract is still a work in progress.}
    X-Ray Diffraction has been a fundamental technique in many areas of science for generations. Essential to the technique is characterization of anode available to the microscopist. This involves developing a spectra of emitted x-radiation such that reconstruction of a lattice or determination of chemical properties is possible. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and effective technique to extract the spectra from a molybdenum anode in Bragg configuration, and demonstrate how this may be used to reconstruct the lattice structure.
