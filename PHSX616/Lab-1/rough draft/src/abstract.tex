We present an apparatus designed for the observation of charged oil droplets in an electric field for the purposes of determining the atomic nature of charge by measuring the force experienced by the particle in an electric field of known strength. While it is easy to produce an electric field of known strength, there is great difficulty in the observation of particles with little charge. By careful observation of charged oil droplets, we find that charge is quantized in nature, directly observing integer multiples of charge on our oil droplets
