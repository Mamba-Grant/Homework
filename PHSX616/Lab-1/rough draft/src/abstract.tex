    %Within physics there are some things that we take to be true without much thought, and perhaps 
    %the greatest culprit of this is the charge of an electron. 

    We aim to determine the charge of an electron by replicating the classic oil drop experiment 
    by directly examining the motion of charged oil droplets under large external electric field.

%An article usually includes an abstract, a concise summary of the work
