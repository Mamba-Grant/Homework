\subsubsection{Experimental Measurement of Charge}

The motion of any charged particle in atmosphere, within an electromagnetic field are easily modelled as a combination free fall, buoyant, and coulomb interactions \cite{MillikanOilDropManual}. These forces take the form, \begin{equation}\label{charge_eq1}
    qE = mg + kv
\end{equation}

By directly observing the motion of particles during free fall and in an electric field independently, we hope to directly determine the charge on the particle. Due to the interaction of buoyant forces on our particle, it may be extremely difficult to track their motion without sophisticated computer hardware, due to the nonlinear nature free fall velocity. For this reason, we opt to observe microscopic particles using with very low mass such that they can be assumed to always be at terminal velocity. A severe consequence of this decision is that the forces on such particles will be incredibly small–on the order of $x$ Newtons. To accomplish this, we use non-volatile oil, introduced into the viewing chamber by an atomizer. With careful consideration of external conditions, it is possible to ascertain the charge on the oil droplets by their free fall velocity and coulomb interaction velocity alone. From (\ref{charge_eq1}) we can express 
\begin{equation}\label{charge_eq2}
    q = \frac{mg(v_f - v_i)}{Ev_f}
\end{equation}

To eliminate $m$ from equation (\ref{charge_eq2}), one uses the expression for the volume of a sphere:
\begin{equation}\label{charge_eq3}
    m = \frac{4}{3}\pi a^3 \rho
\end{equation}

Where $a$ is the radius of the droplet and $\rho$ is the density of oil. We assume that the oil droplets assume perfectly spherical shape due to extremely small terminal velocity. Then Stoke's law is used to relate the radius of the oil droplet to its velocity as it falls through a viscous medium.
\begin{equation}\label{charge_eq4}
    a = \sqrt{ \frac{9 \eta v_f}{2g\rho} }
\end{equation}

Stokes’ Law, however, becomes incorrect when the velocity of fall of the droplets is less than 0.1 cm/s. (Droplets
having this and smaller velocities have radii, on the order of 2 microns, comparable to the mean free path of air
molecules, a condition which violates one of the assumptions made in deriving Stokes’ Law.) Since the velocities
of the droplets used in this experiment will be in the range of 0.01 to 0.001 cm/s, the viscosity must be multiplied
by a correction factor. The resulting effective viscosity is
\begin{equation}\label{charge_eq4}
    \eta_{\textrm{eff}} = \eta \left( \frac{1}{1+\frac{b}{p a}} \right)
\end{equation}

Where $b$ is a constant, $p$ is the atmospheric pressure, and $a$ is the radius of the drop as calculated by the uncorrected form of Stokes’ Law, equation (\ref{charge_eq4}). Then we arrive at a suitable radius for our oil droplets.
\begin{equation}\label{charge_eq6}
    a = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{b}{2p} \right)^{2} + \frac{9\eta v_f}{2g\rho} } - \left( \frac{b}{2p} \right)
\end{equation}

Which in turn yields the following equation for charge 
\begin{equation}\label{charge_eq7}
    q = \frac{6\pi}{E} \sqrt{ \frac{9\eta^{3}}{2g\rho \left( 1 + \frac{b}{pa} \right)^{3} } }(v_f + v_r) \sqrt{v_f}
\end{equation}

Due to the use of a simple air-plate capacitor to generate an electric field, electric field is straightforwardly
\begin{equation}\label{charge_eq8}
    E = \frac{V}{d}
\end{equation}

Where $V$ is the potential difference across the parallel plates separated by the distance $d$

\subsubsection{Considerations in Instrument Configuration}

There are a variety of ways to manipulate charged particles using external electromagnetic fields \cite{2}.
We employ a uniform electric field via a simple plate capacitor due to two key advantages over magnetic fields. The electromagnetic fields created must be uniform such that it is possible to reliably measure the forces acting on particles–for this it is possible to use several devices, however magnetic fields are conventionally produced using windings of wire, dramatically increasing the complexity of optical observation of the particles inside the field. Second, the motion of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field is known to be circular, increasing the complexity in the determination of force. For these reasons, we employ a simple plate capacitor to produce a uniform electric field, as it permits the construction of a straightforward viewing chamber, shown in figure \ref{fig:apparatus_diagram} . A capacitor also has the advantage of producing uniform fields which drive particles in a perfectly vertical manner, simplifying the determination of their motion.
