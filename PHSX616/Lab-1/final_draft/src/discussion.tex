\section{\label{sec:level1}DISCUSSION}\label{sec:discussion}
In this paper, we demonstrate the capability to measure the charge on a microscopic drop of oil. From this, we demonstrate that charge is atomically quantized, given the results in high quality data, seen in table \ref{tab:oil-droplets-hq} We express charge as a function of atmospheric pressure, air viscosity, and capacitor field. We then observe the motion of the droplets to measure velocity, allowing us to calculate the charge on each droplet. The experimental observations point to the quantized nature of charge. Our results have very large uncertainty due primarily to statistical sources; despite this, our values appear to be similar to the commonly accepted value for electron charge, deviating by approximately 13\%. This deviation is constant in all data, leading us to suspect that with the capacity to accurately measure parameters related to viscosity of air and air pressure, it may be possible to achieve higher quality results.
