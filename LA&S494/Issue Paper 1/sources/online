Some ideas:

1. Where do datacenters get their power
    - also, formerly many have pledged to be carbon-negative and water-positive by 2030 or another time (microsoft azure the biggest), will this hold with AI making them want to build more?

2. The magnitude of energy consumption 
3. The magnitude of water consumption
    - This obviously does not destroy any resources, but puts strain on regions with poor supply, it is dictated by money instead of need

4. Difficult to quantify: switching is not only faster but computer architecture could potentially change radically: "spin up" time eliminated
