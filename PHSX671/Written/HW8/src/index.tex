\begin{homeworkProblem}
What is the equation for the entropy of a system consisting of $N$ spin $\frac{1}{2}$ magnetic dipole moments ( $\mu$ ) in an external magnetic field $B$ ? Express your answer in terms of $\mu, \beta$, and $B$. What are the limiting values of the entropy at high temperature and/or weak magnetic field, and at low temperature and/or strong magnetic field. Do these limits make sense?
