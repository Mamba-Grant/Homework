\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The distance from Earth to Alpha Centauri is about \(41 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~km}\). A spaceship travels directly from Earth to Alpha Centauri at a speed of 0.9 c.
\end{enumerate}

(a) (3 pts) How much shorter than \(41 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~km}\) is the distance according to the spaceship travellers.

    \[\begin{split}
        L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2 }{c^2 }} &= 17.87 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~km}\\
        L_0 - L &= 23.13 \times 10^{12}\, \mathrm{~km} 
    \end{split}\]

(b) (5 pts) How much do the spaceship travellers think that they have aged? Calculate this in two ways.

\begin{align*}
    t   &= \gamma (u) (t_0) \to \frac{41000 \times 10^{12}}{0.9c} = \gamma (0.9c) (t_0) \tag{1} \\
    t_0 &= 6.6231 \times 10^7\, \mathrm{~seconds} \\
    d   &= rt \to 17.87 \times 10^{12} = (0.9c)(t)\tag{2} \\
    t   &= 6.6231 \times 10^7\, \mathrm{~seconds}
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item The Enterprise is moving directly away from the Millineum Falcon at relative speed of 0.73 c. On the Millineum Falcon, Han Solo bounces a ball off a wall 3 meters away. It takes the ball \(100 \mathrm{~ms}\) to bounce off the wall and back.
\end{enumerate}

(a) (3 pts) How far away from the wall in Han Solo according to an observer on the Enterprise?

\begin{align*}
    L &= L_0 \sqrt{1- \frac{(0.73\cancel{c})^2}{\cancel{c^2}}} \\
      &= 3\sqrt{1-0.73^2} \\
      &= 2.05\, \mathrm{~m}
\end{align*}

(b) (3 pts) How long does it take the ball to get back to Han Solo according to an observer on the Enterprise?

\begin{align*}
    t &= \gamma(u) t_0 \to \gamma(0.73c)(100) \\
      &= 146\, \mathrm{~ms}
\end{align*}

\end{document}
